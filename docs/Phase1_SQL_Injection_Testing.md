# Phase 1: SQL Injection Testing - Implementation Checklist

## Executive Summary

Phase 1 focuses on **SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerability detection**. This document serves as a todo list for implementing the core functionality.

## Why SQL Injection for Phase 1?

### Ranking & Prevalence
- **OWASP Top 10 2021**: #3 (under "Injection" category)
- **Occurrences**: 274,000+ in OWASP dataset
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Exploitability**: High
- **Detection Rate**: Easier to detect than access control issues

### Practical Benefits
1. Clear success criteria - easy to verify if injection worked
2. Well-documented with extensive resources available
3. Automatable - can be tested programmatically
4. Foundation building - teaches core security principles
5. Still common in AI-generated code

### Why Not Access Control (#1)?
While Broken Access Control is #1 on OWASP Top 10, SQL Injection is better for Phase 1 because:
- Access control requires understanding application logic and user roles
- Context-dependent (each app has different access rules)
- Harder to automate generic tests
- Needs authenticated user sessions
- Better suited for Phase 2

## SQL Injection Types to Detect

### 1. Error-Based SQLi
- **What**: Triggers database errors to reveal information
- **Detection**: Look for SQL error messages in responses
- **Difficulty**: Easiest to implement
- **Priority**: HIGH

### 2. Boolean-Based Blind SQLi
- **What**: Application behavior changes based on TRUE/FALSE
- **Detection**: Compare responses to TRUE vs FALSE conditions
- **Difficulty**: Moderate
- **Priority**: HIGH

### 3. Time-Based Blind SQLi (Phase 1.5)
- **What**: Uses database sleep functions
- **Detection**: Measure response time differences
- **Difficulty**: More complex
- **Priority**: MEDIUM (defer to Phase 1.5)

### 4. Union-Based SQLi (Phase 1.5)
- **What**: Extracts data using UNION queries
- **Detection**: Requires column count enumeration
- **Difficulty**: Complex
- **Priority**: MEDIUM (defer to Phase 1.5)

---

## Testing Workflow

1. **Crawl Target URL** → Discover all pages and links
2. **Identify Input Points** → Find forms and URL parameters
3. **Inject Test Payloads** → Send malicious inputs
4. **Analyze Responses** → Check for vulnerability indicators
5. **Classify Vulnerability** → Determine type and severity
6. **Generate Report** → Document findings with evidence

---

## Test Payload Categories

### Error-Based Payloads (To Implement)
- Single quotes and double quotes
- Basic OR injections
- Comment-based injections
- Numeric injections
- Parenthesis variations

### Boolean-Based Payloads (To Implement)
- TRUE conditions (AND '1'='1')
- FALSE conditions (AND '1'='2')
- Comparison operators
- Numeric variations

### Database-Specific Payloads (Phase 1.5)
- MySQL specific
- PostgreSQL specific
- SQL Server specific

## Notes & Considerations

### Important Reminders
- ⚠️ **Ethics**: Only test applications you own or have permission to test
- ⚠️ **Safety**: Implement rate limiting to avoid DoS
- ⚠️ **Legal**: Display consent warnings prominently
- ⚠️ **Testing**: Always test on intentionally vulnerable apps first

### Architecture Decisions
- Start with in-memory storage (simple)
- Use FastAPI for async support
- Keep modules independent
- Design for easy expansion
- Prioritize security in the tool itself

### Performance Targets
- Scan small site (10-20 pages) in < 5 minutes
- Handle 100+ input points efficiently
- Limit concurrent requests to avoid blocking
- Implement timeout mechanisms
